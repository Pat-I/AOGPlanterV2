🔹 What this is

This is a existing constructor for the class OfRowCrop.

Constructors run automatically whenever you create a new instance of a class (new OfRowCrop(...)).

They’re used to initialize fields, properties, and state of the object.

🔹 Line-by-line

public OfRowCrop(FormAOP _f)

This declares the constructor.

It takes one parameter: _f, which is of type FormAOP (another form/class in your program).

Whoever creates OfRowCrop must pass in a FormAOP object.

var gpsForm = new FormAOP();
var crop = new OfRowCrop(gpsForm);


mf = _f;

mf is probably a field or property in OfRowCrop that stores a reference to a FormAOP.

This line assigns the parameter _f into the class’s member mf.

In other words: “Remember which FormAOP I was given, so I can use it later.”

InitSkip();

Calls a method named InitSkip.

Likely sets up some internal data related to skipping rows/crops (based on the class name).

InitSectionState();

Calls another method, probably to set up section states.

This ensures the object starts out in a valid state right after it’s created.

🔹 Why it looks like this

This pattern is dependency injection:

Instead of OfRowCrop creating its own FormAOP, it accepts one from outside (the _f parameter).

This makes the code more flexible and testable, because OfRowCrop doesn’t have to “know” how to build a FormAOP — it just uses the one it’s given.

✅ In short:
That constructor is saying:
“When you create an OfRowCrop, give me a FormAOP. I’ll save it into mf, then run some initialization methods so I’m ready to use.”
