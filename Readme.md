# AgOpenPlanter
Experimental open source planter monitor app for Wndows.  To run on top of the AgOpenGPS autosteer app to display Ag planter performance.  This is an exercise in precision farming applications for programming students. Not intended for actual use, so don't try this on real live equipment as it may not give accurate information. 

Designed to communicate with a microprocessor based control box programmed to listen to planter's seed sensors and communicate to the Window app via UDP. Also, this is an example of distributed processing as the Arduino based microprocessor determines seed population, skipped seeds, and doubles.
